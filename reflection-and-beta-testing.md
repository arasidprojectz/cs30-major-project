# Beta Testing
## First Beta Tester
- Doesn't properly detect the player collison with tiles
- Movement of player appears to be slow
- Add instructions

## Second Beta Tester
- Fix smaller bugs (enemy collison)
- Combat between player with enemy
- Map Layouts are nice 

# Reflection
## How Much Need To Have Was Finished
- I was able to complete all of my need to haves list, but there's few errors with enemy collision detection with tiles

## Biggest Challenge
- The biggest challenge was to making the tilemap and to  displaying the proper values from the array as well collision detection of player and enemy
- Some minor problems; Finding the angle of bullets, animation of the sprites and object collisions (player with enemy and coins)
- Time management, did not use my time wisely or planned ahead 

## How Was It Solved
- Making objects movement and colision on a 2D grid took some time, but with class demos that makes it easier to understand
- Using trigonometry to calculate the angle of bullets, watch some online videos of sprite animation and use the build-in funcition of object collision 
- The time issues could not be solved

## What Would I Change if I Were to Redo
- Plan more ahead of time
- Better efficiency
- Use more parameters and return functions
